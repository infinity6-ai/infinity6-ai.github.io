<p class="has-text-align-right"><em><sub><sup>03/20/2025 by Everton Gago, <strong>COO infinity6</strong></sup></sub></em><br><em><sub><sup>#businessAI #infinity6 #AI #artificialintelligence #dataintelligence #datadriven</sup></sub></em></p>



<p>In today’s landscape, where personalization and artificial intelligence (AI) are critical for business success, understanding user behavior is essential. In the race to provide more convenience, efficiency and opportunities, three key dimensions shape behavioral modeling: characteristics, actions and time. Together, they enable precise recommendations and personalized experiences, driving value for both customers and companies. The impact goes beyond user satisfaction—it directly influences revenue growth, engagement, retention and brand strength.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">1. Characteristics: Defining the Individual and Items</h3>



<p>The first dimension encompasses user attributes and the features of the items they interact with. In e-commerce, this includes purchase history, brand or category preferences and product attributes such as price and popularity. In streaming services, favorite genres or preferred artists play a crucial role in content recommendations.</p>



<p>This combination allows AI systems to identify patterns and provide suggestions beyond the obvious. For example, a customer purchasing a smartphone may receive recommendations for complementary accessories like cases or chargers. This level of personalization not only increases average order value but also enhances brand perception by demonstrating an understanding of the customer’s needs.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">2. Actions: What the Individual Does</h3>



<p>The second dimension involves user actions, which reflect their interests and intentions. Browsing behavior, clicks, purchases and cart abandonment provide valuable insights into what a user is looking for. On content platforms, metrics such as time spent on an article or skipping a movie help refine recommendations in real-time.</p>



<p>In B2B, for instance, a pharmacy’s purchase history can indicate a need to recommend flu medicine during colder seasons, aligning with consumer demand. By proactively responding to these insights, businesses not only boost engagement but also strengthen customer loyalty by becoming trusted partners that understand their clients’ needs.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">3. Time: When Behavior Occurs</h3>



<p>The third dimension, time, is crucial for maintaining the relevance of recommendations. Recent behaviors carry more weight and AI systems must prioritize them. Additionally, factors like seasonality and consumption cycles influence purchasing decisions. In e-commerce, key periods such as Christmas or seasonal promotions require quick adjustments to highlight high-demand products.</p>



<p>In streaming services, timing also plays a role. Relaxing playlists at night or lighthearted movies on weekends are examples of how temporal context enhances user experience. Delivering recommendations at the right moment increases engagement and retention—critical factors for revenue growth.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Integrating the Three Dimensions</h3>



<p>When combined, these three dimensions create highly personalized recommendations. In a B2B marketplace, for example, understanding customer characteristics (purchase patterns), actions (products bought) and time (replenishment cycles) enables businesses to suggest complementary products or seasonal offers. This approach not only boosts sales volume but also strengthens customer relationships by demonstrating a deep understanding of their business needs.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">The Role of AI and Continuous Learning</h3>



<p>AI plays a fundamental role in dynamically integrating these dimensions. Machine learning systems continuously refine recommendations based on user interactions, anticipating future needs. This capability allows businesses not only to meet expectations but also to surprise users with exploratory suggestions, such as niche content or products outside their usual preferences.</p>



<p>This continuous adaptation and innovation provide a competitive edge, enhancing customer loyalty and positioning the brand as a leader in personalization. Furthermore, by delivering unique experiences, businesses can increase customer lifetime value (LTV), driving long-term revenue growth.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-right"><em><sub><sup>10/19/2024 by Everton Gago, <strong>COO infinity6</strong></sup></sub></em><br><em><sub><sup>#businessAI #infinity6 #AI #artificialintelligence #dataintelligence #datadriven</sup></sub></em></p>



<p>Data is relentless: if it does not generate revenue, it inevitably incurs costs.<br><br>Data and artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming business operations, creating tangible opportunities for growth and efficiency. This article explains how to practically extract value from data, regardless of the maturity of your strategy.</p>



<h5 class="wp-block-heading">BALANCING GROWTH AND SUSTAINABILITY</h5>



<p>According to McKinsey &amp; Company, companies aiming for accelerated growth must develop a robust data strategy. While the process of designing and implementing this strategy may be complex, it can be built incrementally, capturing value in small steps.</p>



<p>To develop a data strategy that keeps your business competitive, focus on these four pillars:</p>



<p><strong>1. Data capture and integration</strong><br>Efficiently integrating operational data from channels, products, and external sources is essential. If your company or department is not doing this well, start with small pilot projects to test new data capture and integration methods. These initial steps allow for constant innovation and quick adaptation to market changes, fostering incremental growth.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left"><em><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">&#8220;If you are collecting data that is not immediately used to capture business value, stop. That data might be useless! Data that does not feed into analytics, predictive models, or key decision-support indicators is garbage. Do not waste time managing and updating data that serves no purpose.&#8221;</mark></em></p>



<p><strong>2. Actionable insights</strong><br>Convert data into actionable insights, integrating them into both operational and strategic decisions. Start with specific analyses that deliver immediate impact, gradually expanding into a continuous process that spans the entire organization. This ensures data-driven decisions are constantly improving processes.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left"><em><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">&#8220;What customer behaviors did you identify last month, and how have they impacted your predictive models, KPIs, or internal processes? Start with a small initiative, learn from it, build an isolated process, and then scale it up.&#8221;</mark></em></p>



<p><strong>3. Strategic partnerships</strong><br>Collaborating with technology and business partners enriches your data ecosystem. Establish partnerships in stages, starting with smaller collaborations and gradually expanding your data utilization capacity. This enhances the value of collected data and improves service offerings.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left"><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color"><em>&#8220;Which partners are helping you identify growth opportunities for your business? SaaS solutions offer low-friction experimentation and rapid impact realization. If you are not leveraging specialized partners to move quickly, you are likely giving your competitors a head start.&#8221;</em></mark></p>



<p><strong>4. Operational efficiency</strong><br>Foster a culture of efficiency that values resource optimization and adaptability. Encourage a collaborative and continuous learning work environment from the start. Focus on results-driven management and creating an atmosphere that encourages productive behavior and drives success. People’s behaviors are shaped by the results they achieve and the environment in which they operate.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left"><em><mark style="background-color:rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" class="has-inline-color has-vivid-cyan-blue-color">&#8220;Stuck in the hire-or-build dilemma? Do both! Work with partners to validate gains, and then internalize only what is essential. Many companies try to build expert teams without knowing which applications will deliver results, and without the appeal to attract and retain talent. Be strategic: validate first, internalize later, and only what makes sense.&#8221;</mark></em></p>

<p class="has-text-align-right"><em><sup>10/18/2024 by Leonardo Chaves, <strong>CEO infinity6</strong></sup></em><br><em><sup><sub>#businessAI #infinity6 #AI #artificialintelligence #hyperpersonalization #datadriven</sub></sup></em></p>



<p>The foundation of hyperpersonalization, or even basic personalization, lies in behavior. While this is not new, it is crucial to highlight that behavior is an extremely volatile data point, as it is intrinsically tied to human nature, with all its complexity and diversity of desires, needs and preferences. When discussing the requirements for a highly accurate hyperpersonalization process, data must be regarded as the main driver of efficiency. However, it is not just about having data or building a data lake; the strategy for extracting and orchestrating data is <strong>making it intelligent enough to drive decision-making</strong>. That is the essential requirement.</p>



<p>Data quality is not solely about volume (though that is important), but rather <strong>how everything connects within its own ecosystem and the broader external ecosystem</strong>, as no company stands alone in the value chain for its customers. This type of connection enables a shift from a rearview personalization perspective, which is more analytical, to a binocular view: more predictive and prescriptive. This is the key to creating truly differentiated experiences.</p>



<p>By focusing on the customer perspective, personalization aims to meet the expectations of the modern consumer, who demands more tailored interactions and wants companies to understand and fulfill their desires. <strong>We are in the age of convenience</strong>! Consumers do not want to waste time shopping; they want to solve a need. And if they can do this in the most optimized and efficient way possible, freeing up time for what they truly enjoy, that is likely the best experience you can create. It is important to note that people expect personalization, not individualization.<strong> It is not about individual context, but addressing individual needs within a broader social and collective context</strong>.</p>
