While this is not new, it is crucial to highlight that behavior is an extremely volatile data point, as it is intrinsically tied to human nature, with all its complexity and diversity of desires, needs and preferences. When discussing the requirements for a highly accurate hyperpersonalization process, data must be regarded as the main driver of efficiency. However, it is not just about having data or building a data lake; the strategy for extracting and orchestrating data is <strong>making it intelligent enough to drive decision-making<\/strong>. That is the essential requirement.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Data quality is not solely about volume (though that is important), but rather <strong>how everything connects within its own ecosystem and the broader external ecosystem<\/strong>, as no company stands alone in the value chain for its customers. This type of connection enables a shift from a rearview personalization perspective, which is more analytical, to a binocular view: more predictive and prescriptive. This is the key to creating truly differentiated experiences.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By focusing on the customer perspective, personalization aims to meet the expectations of the modern consumer, who demands more tailored interactions and wants companies to understand and fulfill their desires. <strong>We are in the age of convenience<\/strong>! Consumers do not want to waste time shopping; they want to solve a need. And if they can do this in the most optimized and efficient way possible, freeing up time for what they truly enjoy, that is likely the best experience you can create. It is important to note that people expect personalization, not individualization.<strong> It is not about individual context, but addressing individual needs within a broader social and collective context<\/strong>.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>10\/18\/2024\u00a0by\u00a0Leonardo Chaves, CEO infinity6#businessAI #infinity6 #AI #artificialintelligence #hyperpersonalization #datadriven The foundation of hyperpersonalization, or even basic personalization, lies in behavior.
